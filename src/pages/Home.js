                Mathematics ( includes the study of such topics as numbers (arithmetic and number theory),
                formulas and related structures (algebra), shapes and spaces in which they are contained
                (geometry), and quantities and their changes (calculus and analysis).There is no general
                consensus about its exact scope or epistemological status.

                A software calculator is a calculator that has been implemented as a computer program,
                rather than as a physical hardware device. They are among the simpler interactive
                software tools, and, as such, they provide operations for the user to select one
                at a time. They can be used to perform any process that consists of a sequence
                of steps each of which applies one of these operations, and have no purpose other
                than these processes, because the operations are the sole, or at least
                the primary, features of the calculator, rather than being secondary
                features that support other functionality that is not normally known simply
                as calculation.
